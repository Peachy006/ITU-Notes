# Different stuff
#### Subsets
A subset can only be a proper subset if it contains all the elements but at the same time is not equal to the other set, so assume we have a set A = {1,2} then the set {1} would be a proper subset, but the set {1,2} would not be a proper subset, but it would still be a subset
#### Union
A union is written as "U" and is the total of 2 different sets:

#### Intersection
Intersection is written as an upside down U, it is the elements that appear in both sets, therefore![[Pasted image 20250919124019.png]]
#### Difference
This is pretty much just subtraction, A - B would be taking away the elements in A that also appear in B

#### Complement

#### Cartesian product

Cartesian product is just pretty much pairing up 2 sets, so ![[Pasted image 20250919124532.png]]

## Relations and their properties

#### Relation


#### Power sets
Pretty much all the combinations you can make in a set
