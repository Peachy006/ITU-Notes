You can do this by using recursion

base case:

bin(0) = 0;
bin(1) = 1;
else {
bin(n) = bin(n/2) + 0(if n is even) or (1 if n is odd)
}

so bin(7) is 111 because:

bin (3) + 1
bin 3 = bin(1) + 1;
bin 1 = 1

so  111 
this means the binary representation of 7 is 111

Youre welcome future me


another way is

yea that one is propably easier
but i think its n squared so maybe not?
